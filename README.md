# MongoDB Atlas Cluster with GCP
    
## Key Features and Components
1. `Atlas Cluster Configuration:` The child module allows you to specify various configuration parameters for the Atlas Cluster, including the cluster name, version, type, cloud provider, cluster size, and region. These parameters determine the characteristics and resources allocated to the cluster.

2. `Network and Connectivity:` The module supports configuring network-related settings, such as the project ID, network name, and subnet name. It enables you to define the network environment in which the cluster will be deployed and connected.

3. `High Availability and Scalability:` The module supports defining the desired high availability and scalability options for the cluster. You can specify the number of shards, electable nodes, priority, and read-only nodes to tailor the cluster's behavior according to your needs.

4. `Authentication and Database User:` The module allows you to define a database user with a username, password, and associated roles. This user is used for authenticating and accessing the MongoDB database.

5. `Custom Labels:` You can assign custom labels to the Atlas Cluster using key-value pairs. This helps in organizing and categorizing the clusters based on specific attributes.

6. `Cloud Provider Integration:` The module provides integration with cloud providers like GCP (Google Cloud Platform). It enables you to associate the cluster with a specific GCP project, region, and subnet. It also supports configuring private link connectivity between the cluster and the GCP project.

# MongoDB Atlas Cluster Backup Solution with Bastion Host
This solution provides a method to take external backups from our MongoDB Atlas Cluster (tier M10) and store them in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. MongoDB Atlas does not natively support external backups to GCS, so we have implemented a solution using a bastion host.

## Bastion Host Setup
1. We have created a bastion host in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that acts as an intermediary server to establish a secure connection with the MongoDB Atlas Cluster.

2. On the bastion host, we have installed the necessary dependencies, including the MongoDB tools (mongodump, mongorestore, etc.) and the gsutil command-line tool to export the snapshot to a GCS bucket.

3. Authentication has been configured on the bastion host to establish a secure connection with the MongoDB Atlas Cluster. This ensures that only authorized access is allowed.

4. The bastion host and the MongoDB Atlas Cluster are associated via a private endpoint, ensuring a secure and isolated communication channel for backups.

## Backup Process Automation
1. We have prepared a backup script that runs on the bastion host. This script utilizes the installed tools and dependencies to take backups from the MongoDB Atlas Cluster and store them in a GCS bucket.

2. The backup script runs as a background service and is scheduled to run periodically according to your desired frequency. This ensures that regular backups are created without manual intervention.

3. The script leverages the mongodump command to create a backup of the MongoDB database, and the gsutil command to securely transfer the backup file to the specified GCS bucket.

By following these steps, we have automated the process of taking backups from the MongoDB Atlas Cluster and storing them in a secure Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The backup script ensures regular backups are created, and you have the flexibility to configure the frequency of backups based on your requirements.

Please note that this solution serves as a starting point and should be customized to fit your specific environment and security needs. It's important to review the code, configuration files, and security measures to ensure they align with your organization's best practices and compliance requirements.
